# Question-Paper-Generator-AI-Project-

I made this question paper generator

In this system I present a smart question paper generating system.

I allow the administrator to input a set of questions.

I allow admin to provide weight age and complexity for each of these questions.

After this the questions are stored in the database along with their weight age. 

Now on question paper generating time, the admin just hast to select the difficulty. 

On this section the system selects the questions randomly in a way that their weight age makes up for 100 marks and according to difficulty that admin chooses. 

The questions are chosen based on their complexity level. 

After this question paper is converted to pdf file and emailed to colleges automatically.
